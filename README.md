# NotePad

This is my first node.js application. I am creating a notepad that will allow you to add,list,remove,and read notes. It's still under construction so I will be committing changes often.

In order for the app to run:

Example:
node app.js (instruction) -t ="" -b=""

Commands:
  app.js add     Add a new note
  app.js list    List all notes
  app.js read    Read a Note
  app.js remove  Remove a Note


If you need a list of the instruction available type:
node app.js --help

This will display the options you have. You can also either enter the title as 
--title or -t
also for the body
--body or -b
